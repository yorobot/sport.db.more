## Usage


To get started use the `wfb` command-line tool.

List all (pre-configured) leagues:

```
$ wfb leagues
```

Print the match schedue of a league (season). Let's try the English Premier League:

```
$ wfb eng.1 2024/25
$ wfb eng.1 2024/25 --offline    # use cached (offline local) pages
```

Or try the DFB Pokal (that is, the German Cup):

```
$ wfb de.cup 2024/25 --offline    # use cached (offline local) pages
```

and so on.






### More

Debugging tips. List all cached (offline local) match schedule pages:

```
$ wfb cache
```
