The '''2022 FIFA World Cup final''' was the final match of the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], the 22nd edition of [[FIFA]]'s competition for [[List of men's national association football teams|men's national football teams]]. The match was played at [[Lusail Stadium]] in [[Lusail]], Qatar, on 18 December 2022, [[National Day (Qatar)|the Qatari National Day]], and was contested by [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] and defending champions [[France national football team|France]]. With a record 1.5 billion people watching on television, the final became one of the most widely watched televised sporting events in history.<ref>{{cite web |last=FIFA |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/news/one-month-on-5-billion-engaged-with-the-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-tm |title=One Month On: 5 billion engaged with the FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 |date=18 January 2023 |access-date=22 May 2023 |archive-date=18 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230118183433/https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/news/one-month-on-5-billion-engaged-with-the-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-tm |url-status=live}}</ref>

The tournament comprised hosts [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] and 31 other teams who emerged victorious from [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification|the qualification phase]], organised by the six [[List of football federations#FIFA Confederations|FIFA confederations]]. The 32 teams competed in a group stage, from which 16 teams qualified for [[2022 FIFA World Cup knockout stage|the knockout stage]]. En route to the final, Argentina finished first in [[2022 FIFA World Cup Group C|Group C]], first losing to Saudi Arabia 2–1, then defeating both [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and [[Poland national football team|Poland]] 2–0. They then beat [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia]] 2–1 in the round of 16, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] in the quarter-final through a [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] after it ended 2–2 in extra time, and [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] in the semi-final 3–0. France finished first in [[2022 FIFA World Cup Group D|Group D]] with two wins and one loss (4–1 win over [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia]], 2–1 win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and a 1–0 loss to [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]]), defeating Poland 3–1 in the round of 16, [[England national football team|England]] 2–1 in the quarter-final, and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] 2–0 in the semi-final. The final took place in front of 88,966 spectators and was [[Referee (association football)|refereed]] by [[Szymon Marciniak]].

Argentina took the lead through a [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty]] by [[Lionel Messi]] in the 23rd minute before [[Ángel Di María]] further increased their lead in the 36th minute with a low shot into the corner of the goal after a sweeping Argentina counterattack. France failed to register a shot at the goal for the vast majority of the match until a 97-second brace by [[Kylian Mbappé]] tied the game 2–2 in the 81st minute. During [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]], Messi then scored again to give Argentina a 3–2 lead. However, Mbappé scored a second penalty to tie the game 3–3 with just a few minutes remaining, becoming the second man to score a [[hat-trick (association football)|hat-trick]] in a World Cup final after [[Geoff Hurst]] in [[1966 FIFA World Cup final|1966]]. Argentina then won the ensuing penalty shoot-out 4–2 to win their third World Cup, and first since [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]].

It was the second time that Argentina reached the World Cup final after losing their opening match (the other occasion being in [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]]), a feat three other teams have achieved ([[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], and [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]); it was only the second time in history that a team went on to win the tournament after losing their opening match (following Spain in 2010). France became the first team in history to score three goals in a World Cup final and lose. Messi was named the [[Player of the match|man of the match]] and won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]] as FIFA's best player of the tournament. 

The match was ranked by the football media  and fans alike as one of the greatest [[List of FIFA World Cup finals|World Cup finals]], and one of the greatest football matches in the history of the sport.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cormack |first1=James |last2=Gallagher |first2=Jack |date=20 December 2022 |title=The best World Cup finals ever |url=https://www.90min.com/posts/the-best-world-cup-finals-ever |access-date=26 January 2023 |archive-date=23 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230223101502/https://www.90min.com/posts/the-best-world-cup-finals-ever |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Sanders |first1=Emma |title=World Cup 2022: Was Argentina's win over France the best ever final? |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64019067 |website=BBC Sport |access-date=25 May 2024 |date=18 December 2022}}</ref>

====Second half====
Argentina were on course for the win, controlling possession, and defensively shutting down France, who failed to make an attempt on goal until the 80th minute, at which point France was awarded a penalty after Randal Kolo Muani was brought down in the penalty area by [[Nicolás Otamendi]]. Kylian Mbappé scored the penalty low to the left corner, despite Emiliano Martínez getting a hand on the ball, making the game 2–1. 97 seconds later, [[Kingsley Coman]] tackled Messi right as the game restarted, starting a rapid counter-attack which finished with Mbappé first-time volleying a lofted pass from [[Marcus Thuram]] with his right foot as he was falling to the ground to the bottom-right corner of the net to make the game 2–2; Martínez again attempted to parry the ball but couldn't keep it out. Five minutes after Mbappé's equalizer, Thuram went down in the penalty box after slightly tripping on Enzo Fernández's leg, only to be booked for [[Diving (association football)|diving]]. Both teams came close to finishing the game near the end of added time as Adrien Rabiot fired a quick shot inside the box, forcing a fumbling save from Emiliano Martínez; then three minutes later Messi had a hard shot parried over the bar by [[Hugo Lloris]]. With the score tied at the end of regulation time, the match went to extra time.<ref name="Argentina 3 France 3 4–2 on pens">{{cite web |date=18 December 2022 |title=Argentina 3 France 3 (4–2 on pens) |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63932622 |access-date=20 December 2022 |website=[[BBC Sport]] |archive-date=4 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230304213809/https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63932622 |url-status=live}}</ref>

However, France was awarded a second penalty in the 118th minute after a shot by Mbappé hit the arm of [[Gonzalo Montiel]].<ref name="Argentina 3 France 3 4–2 on pens"/> Mbappé scored his third goal with his penalty kick to the left, sending Martínez the wrong way and becoming the second player to score a [[hat-trick]] in a men's World Cup final after [[Geoff Hurst]] for England in [[1966 FIFA World Cup final|1966]].<ref name="NBCNews" /> In the 123rd minute, with 15 seconds of the extra time to spare, a loose ball fell to an unmarked Kolo Muani at the edge of the box, who shot low to the right of the goal; however, Emiliano Martínez blocked the shot with his left shin. Argentina counter-attacked immediately, ending with Lautaro Martínez heading wide of the goal from 10 yards.<ref name="NBCNews" /> France produced one last attack when Mbappé dribbled in the penalty box, passing three Argentina defenders, only for [[Paulo Dybala]] to make a timely clearance off the field.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Murray |first=Scott |date=18 December 2022 |title=2022 World Cup final: Argentina 3–3 France (aet, 4–2 on pens) – as it happened |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/dec/18/argentina-france-world-cup-2022-final-live |access-date=3 April 2023 |issn=0261-3077 |archive-date=4 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230204082148/https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2022/dec/18/argentina-france-world-cup-2022-final-live |url-status=live}}</ref> The referee then blew the final whistle of extra time and the match went to a penalty shoot-out.

====Penalty shoot-out====
This was the third time the World Cup final would be decided on penalties. Mbappé and Messi successfully converted the first two attempts to begin the penalty shootout at 1–1. Argentina goalkeeper Martínez would continue to use the psychological tactics and means of [[gamesmanship#Association football|gamesmanship]] that he utilized during the [[Battle of Lusail#Penalty shoot-out|penalty shoot-outs]] in the quarter-final against the Netherlands. After delaying Kingsley Coman's attempt by arguing with the referee, Martínez then saved Coman's shot, which was down low to Martínez's right.<ref name=Mukhopadhyay2023>{{cite web |last=Mukhopadhyay |first=Sounak |url=https://www.livemint.com/news/world/what-emi-martinez-said-when-he-was-told-penalty-rules-would-change-after-his-mind-games-in-wc-final-11677137126455.html |title=What Emi Martinez said when he was told penalty rules would change after his mind-games in WC final |work=[[Mint (newspaper)|Mint]] |date=23 February 2023 |accessdate=19 December 2023|archive-date=26 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230926132231/https://www.livemint.com/news/world/what-emi-martinez-said-when-he-was-told-penalty-rules-would-change-after-his-mind-games-in-wc-final-11677137126455.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Dybala sent a shot into the net up the middle to give Argentina a 2–1 lead.
