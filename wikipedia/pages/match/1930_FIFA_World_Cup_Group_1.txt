[[File:Stabile hurac 1926.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Guillermo Stábile]] scored five times for [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in Group 1 as he went on to win the [[FIFA World Cup Golden Boot]]]]
Group 1 of the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] was one of four groups in the opening round of tournament. The group featured [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]], [[France national football team|France]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. Play began on 13 July 1930 when France defeated Mexico  4–1 in the opening match. [[Lucien Laurent]] scored the first goal in World Cup history after 19 minutes to give his side the lead. France played again in the second fixture, suffering defeat against Argentina in a controversial match which saw the referee mistakenly blow the whistle for full-time six minutes early.

Chile defeated Mexico 3–0 in the two sides' first World Cup match, before Chile eliminated France in their next game with a 1–0 victory in a match which featured the first penalty kick awarded in World Cup history, [[Carlos Vidal]]'s effort was saved by French goalkeeper [[Alex Thépot]]. Argentina defeated Mexico 6–3 in the group's next match in which [[Guillermo Stábile]] scored a [[hat-trick]] on his international debut. Play concluded on 22 July 1930 with Argentina playing Chile to determine the group winner for a place in the semi-finals. Stábile added two more goals as his side won 3–1 to win the group and advance. Chile, France and Mexico were subsequently eliminated from the competition. Argentina went on to reach the [[1930 FIFA World Cup final|final]], losing 4–2 to hosts [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].

==Background==
Group 1 was one of four groups in the opening round of the [[1930 FIFA World Cup]] in Uruguay. The competition featured 13 sides, split into one group of four teams and three groups of three teams. The sides would play each other on a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin basis]] with the top nation in each group advancing to the semi-finals.<ref name="mc">{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/1930uruguay/match-center |title=Match Centre 1930 FIFA World Cup |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=19 January 2023}}</ref> There was no qualification process for the competition, instead all 41 member states of governing body [[FIFA]] were invited to participate. However,
the choice of Uruguay as host nation resulted in most declining to participate due to costs and the length of travel involved.<ref name="tft">{{cite web |url=https://thesefootballtimes.co/2014/09/04/the-story-of-the-1930-world-cup/ |title=The Story of the 1930 World Cup |work=These Football Times |last=Benjamin |first=Brian |date=4 September 2014 |accessdate=19 January 2023}}</ref>

The tournament did prove popular with teams from the Americas and 9 of the 13 participants came from the region. Three of these, [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Chile national football team|Chile]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] were placed into Group 1 along with one of the four European entrants, [[France national football team|France]].<ref>{{harvnb|FIFA|2017|p=17}}</ref> Argentina were one of the favourites for the tournament having reached the final of the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Olympics]] before being beaten by Uruguay.<ref>{{harvnb|Glanville|2005|p=16}}</ref> Mexico, in contrast, were relatively unknown as their [[Mexican Football Association|football association]] had only been founded three years prior to the tournament and their only international victories had come against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]].<ref>{{harvnb|Crouch|2002|p=4}}</ref><ref name="freddi3"/> France had been reluctant to enter but had been persuaded by FIFA president [[Jules Rimet]], a Frenchman, to participate, although coach [[Gaston Barreau]] and leading player [[Manuel Anatol]] both refused to travel.<ref name="tft"/>

===France vs Mexico===
[[File:Lucien Laurent, Marcel Langiller, 1930.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lucien Laurent]] and [[Marcel Langiller]], the scorers of the first and second goals in [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] history]]
This was the first ever meeting between the two sides,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/mexico/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/France/ |title=Mexico national football team: record v France |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=19 January 2023}}</ref> and would be one of the two opening games of the tournament, starting at the same time as the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] match in [[1930 FIFA World Cup Group 4|Group 4]].<ref name="freddi3"/> France had been chosen for the opening match to mark [[Bastille Day]] the following day.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Dunlop Book of the World Cup |year=1973 |last=Guiney |first=David |publisher=Eastland Press |location=Suffolk |page=13 |isbn=0903214032}}</ref> There had been some snowfall prior to the start of the competition, leaving the conditions cold and wintery. France opened the scoring after 19 minutes, [[Lucien Laurent]] converting a cross from [[Ernest Libérati]] to score the first goal in World Cup history.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/1930uruguay/news/lucien-laurent-the-first-world-cup-goalscorer |title=Lucien Laurent, the first World Cup goalscorer |publisher=FIFA |date=13 July 2020 |accessdate=24 January 2023}}</ref> The French goalkeeper [[Alex Thépot]] was forced off the field with injury during the first half after being kicked in the jaw during a challenge with an opposition player.

Mexico looked to push forward in the second half and were able to score their first goal of the competition when [[Juan Carreño]] finished from [[Dionisio Mejía]]'s pass. However, it proved to be only a consolation goal as France scored a fourth in the final minutes of the game, Maschinot scoring his second after Langiller had played a cross into the penalty area. Mexico's [[Manuel Rosas (footballer, born 1912)|Manuel]] and [[Felipe Rosas]] became the first brothers to play together in a World Cup during the game.<ref name="freddi3"/> The match would remain the highest scoring World Cup opening match until [[Germany national football team|Germany]] defeated [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] 4–2 in the opening game of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/germany-v-costa-rica-09-june-2006-273710/ |title=Germany v Costa Rica, 09 June 2006 |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=19 January 2023}}</ref>

===Argentina vs France===
Unusually, France played their next match 48 hours later, this time meeting Argentina in their opponent's first game.<ref name="freddi3"/> This was the first ever meeting between the two sides.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/france/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Argentina/ |title=France national football team: record v Argentina |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=19 January 2023}}</ref> Despite his injury in the previous game, Thépot started in goal for the French but his side suffered another injury in the opening minutes of the match when [[Luis Monti]] heavily tackled Laurent resulting in the French player spending the rest of the game limping and ineffective.<ref name="freddi4">{{harvnb|Freddi|2002|p=4}}</ref> The Argentinians were the stronger of the two sides and only the goalkeeping of Thépot was able to keep them from scoring for much of the game. However, his resilience came to an end in the 81st minute when Monti scored direct from a free-kick with Thépot's view blocked by his teammates assembling a wall.<ref name="freddi4"/>

France immediately pushed for an equaliser with Langiller breaking through the Argentine defence in the 84th minute. However, Brazilian referee [[Gilberto de Almeida Rêgo|Almeida Rêgo]] blew his whistle to signal full-time despite having six minutes of regular time remaining. The French players immediately accosted the referee but it took several minutes for order to be restored as mounted police tried to clear celebrating Uruguyan and Argentine fans from the pitch and [[Roberto Cherro]] received treatment after fainting. Eventually, the match resumed but France were unable to find an equalising goal as the match ended 1–0.<ref>{{harvnb|Glanville|2005|p=18}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Lisi|2007|p=11}}</ref>

===Argentina vs Mexico===
{{see also|Argentina–Mexico football rivalry}}
This was the first ever meeting between the two sides and served as the second part of the double header after the France against Chile match played earlier in the day.<ref name="freddi5"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/argentina/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Mexico/ |title=Argentina national football team: record v Mexico |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=20 January 2023}}</ref> With captain [[Manuel Ferreira (footballer)|Manuel Ferreira]] having returned home to sit a law exam, [[Guillermo Stábile]] was selected in attack for Argentina to make his international debut. He led his side into an early lead, scoring twice in the opening 17 minutes either side of a goal by teammate [[Adolfo Zumelzú]]. Argentina had a chance to add a fourth five minutes later when they were awarded a penalty after a handball, but [[Fernando Paternoster]]'s effort was saved by [[Oscar Bonfiglio]].<ref name="freddi5"/> Some sources have stated that Paternoster, disagreeing with the decision to award a penalty and in the spirit of fair play, deliberately hit the ball weakly to Bonfiglio. While the referee, also conceding his decision to award the penalty was incorrect, deliberately extended his stride to measure the distance for the spot kick, leaving Paternoster four yards further away than required.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://elpais.com/deportes/mundial-futbol/2022-11-25/argentina-mexico-1930-el-primer-fair-play-de-la-historia-de-los-mundiales.html |title=Argentina - México 1930: el primer 'fair play' de la historia de los Mundiales |publisher=El Pais |last=Burgo |first=Andres |date=25 November 2022 |accessdate=23 January 2023 |language=es}}</ref>

Mexico pulled a goal back shortly before half-time; Manuel Rosas became the first person to score a penalty at a World Cup when he converted his effort.<ref name="lisi12">{{harvnb|Lisi|2007|p=12}}</ref> Argentina added two more goals in the early stages of the second half, [[Francisco Varallo]] scored his first goal of the competition before Zumelzú scored his second two minutes later.<ref name="freddi5"/> Mexico were awarded a second penalty in the 72nd minute, Rosas' initial effort was saved by [[Ángel Bossio]], deputising as captain in Ferreira's absence, in the Argentine goal but he always able to convert the rebound.<ref>{{harvnb|FIFA|2017|p=18}}</ref> This spurred the Mexicans on and they scored a third soon after through [[Roberto Gayón]] to bring the score to 5–3. However, Stábile completed his hat-trick shortly after to end Argentina's nerves as the match finished 6–3, eliminating Mexico.<ref name="freddi6">{{harvnb|Freddi|2002|p=6}}</ref>

===Argentina vs Chile===
This was the 18th meeting between the two sides in international competition, with Chile having never beaten Argentina in their previous fixtures.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/chile/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Argentina/ |title=Chile national football team: record v Argentina |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=20 January 2023}}</ref> The match would determine which team would win the group and advance to the semi-finals. Stábile continued his good form from the previous match by scoring twice in the opening 15 minutes, although Chile pulled a goal back almost immediately through Subiabre.<ref name="lisi12"/> Shortly before halftime, Monti came together with [[Casimiro Torres (Chilean footballer)|Casimiro Torres]], bringing down the Chilean with a heavy tackle, which led to a mass brawl between the two sides. Referee [[John Langenus]] later described the aftermath of the tackle: "the Chilean grabbed hold of Monti's head with one hand and, with the other, delivered a vicious uppercut". The brawl quickly spread to the rest of the teams, with Langenus noting "All at once, every Argentinian player seemed to throw themselves upon the nearest Chilean and engage in 11 separate boxing matches".<ref>{{harvnb|FIFA|2017|p=19}}</ref> Officials and police desperately tried to restore order and the half was eventually brought to and end with the score remaining 2–1.<ref name="freddi6"/>

Despite the tensions in the first half, the second saw no repeat of any animosity. Argentina extended their lead in the 51st minute when [[Mario Evaristo]] scored. Bossio produced several saves to deny Chile any further goals as Argentina secured a 3–1 victory, advancing them to the semi-finals and eliminating Chile.<ref name="freddi6"/><ref name="lisi13">{{harvnb|Lisi|2007|p=13}}</ref>
