Group B of the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] took place from 21 to 29 November 2022. The group consisted of national [[association football]] teams from [[England national football team|England]], [[Iran national football team|Iran]], the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]]. Both England and the United States progressed to the round of 16 undefeated. England won the group, winning two games and drawing the other, while the United States won one game and drew the other two. Iran finished the group third, having won a game, with Wales finishing fourth with a single point.

Initially noted for unusually containing four teams all ranked in the top 20 at the time of the tournament, as well as two teams within the same sovereign state and other geopolitical conflicts, various incidents relating to Qatar's ban on [[LGBTQ+]] symbols affected the games on the first match day.

===Captains' armbands===
[[File:دیدار تیم‌های فوتبال ایران و انگلیس- جام جهانی ۲۰۲۲ (19).jpg|thumb|alt=See caption.|Harry Kane in England's first match, wearing a FIFA "No discrimination" armband]]
England captain [[Harry Kane]], Wales captain [[Gareth Bale]], and several other European captains intended to wear [[OneLove]] [[Rainbow flag (LGBT)|rainbow armbands]] promoting acceptance and diversity during the World Cup; shortly before England's opening match (the first match to feature one of these nations), however, [[FIFA]] announced that players wearing these armbands would face "unlimited" sanctions, with a [[Penalty card#Association football|yellow card]] given at minimum.<ref>{{cite news |title=World Cup 2022: Why are people talking about the OneLove armband |website=CBBC Newsround |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/63702853 |access-date=2022-11-24}}</ref><ref name=Wembley/> The affected [[football association]]s said they would not put their players in this position, criticising FIFA for the ruling.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Collings |first=Simon |date=2022-11-21 |title=Alex Scott wears OneLove armband during BBC coverage of England vs Iran |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/alex-scott-one-love-armband-bbc-england-iran-world-cup-2022-b1041448.html |access-date=2022-11-21 |website=Evening Standard}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news |last=Rumsby |first=Ben |date=2022-11-21 |title=BBC's Alex Scott wears OneLove armband after Kane and England bow to Fifa pressure |work=The Telegraph |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2022/11/21/bbc-pundit-alex-scott-wears-onelove-armband-england-u-turn/ |access-date=2022-11-21 |issn=0307-1235}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=World Cup news – latest: Anger at iPlayer issues; 'tickets disappear from phones' in Qatar; Welsh fans have rainbow bucket hats removed |url=https://news.sky.com/story/world-cup-news-latest-england-face-armband-dilemma-amid-instant-yellow-card-fears-as-bbc-prompts-storm-with-qatar-opening-ceremony-decision-12752191 |access-date=2022-11-22 |publisher=Sky News }}</ref> A spokesperson for [[Rishi Sunak]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], also criticised FIFA for introducing player punishment for the armbands.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-11-21 |title=WM 2022: Fifa verbietet nach "One Love"-Binde auch belgische Trikots |language=de |work=DIE WELT |url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/article242242459/WM-2022-Fifa-verbietet-nach-One-Love-Binde-auch-belgische-Trikots.html |access-date=2022-11-22}}</ref> After the first United States match, and though the US had not been intending to wear the armband, [[Antony Blinken]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], described the ban as "concerning".<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Reals |first1=Tucker |last2=Williams |first2=Holly |date=22 November 2022 |title=Blinken calls FIFA's "One Love" armband ban "concerning" as LGBTQ soccer fans lament "tarnished" World Cup |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/2022-world-cup-fifa-qatar-lgbtq-armband-blinken-freedom-expression/ |access-date=2022-11-22 |publisher=CBS}}</ref>

At the England–Iran match, [[BBC]] pundit and former [[England women's national football team|England women's team]] captain [[Alex Scott (footballer, born 1984)|Alex Scott]] chose to wear a OneLove armband while being interviewed pitchside ahead of the match, a move that was praised on social media.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> At the United States–Wales match, though she did not appear on screen, German [[ZDF]] broadcaster Claudia Neumann wore a rainbow armband and [[Pride flag|Pride]] shirt, later telling the [[Sport-Informations-Dienst]] that she wanted to set an example, lamenting that the captains would not be able to wear the armbands.<ref>{{Cite web |date=22 November 2022 |title=German World Cup commentator wears rainbow in broadcast |url=https://www.dw.com/en/german-world-cup-commentator-wears-rainbow-in-broadcast/a-63836494 |access-date=2022-11-22 |publisher=Deutsche Welle}}</ref> England would change their armband to one that simply read "no discrimination".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12752273/england-three-lions-among-seven-countries-to-confirm-they-will-not-wear-onelove-armband-in-qatar|title=England: Three Lions among seven countries to confirm they will not wear OneLove armband in Qatar|website=Sky Sports}}</ref> During England's second match, the [[Wembley Stadium]] arch, iconic of the team's home stadium, was lit up in rainbow colours.<ref name=Wembley>{{cite news |title=Unlimited sanctions threat on OneLove armband – FA |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63763638 |access-date=2022-11-27}}</ref>

===Other Pride items===
Many Wales fans in attendance at their first match as part of the nation's official [[LGBTQ+]] supporters group wore the group's rainbow [[Wales bucket hat]]s. Women who had these hats, including former [[Wales women's national football team|women's team]] captain [[Laura McAllister]], were prohibited from entering the stadium with them; McAllister reported that the security officials told her it was "a banned symbol".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-21 |title=Wales fans have rainbow-coloured hats confiscated before USA game in Qatar |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/21/wales-fans-have-rainbow-coloured-hats-confiscated-before-usa-game-in-qatar |access-date=2022-11-22 |website=The Guardian }}</ref> At the same match, American journalist [[Grant Wahl]] was reportedly detained for 25 minutes when attempting to enter the stadium wearing a Pride shirt, being told it was "political" and being asked if he was British; he said that FIFA later apologised to him and security allowed him to enter with the shirt.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-21 |title=US journalist Grant Wahl says he was detained in Qatar for rainbow shirt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/21/us-journalist-grant-wahl-says-he-was-detained-in-qatar-for-rainbow-shirt |access-date=2022-11-22 |website=The Guardian }}</ref>

After the match, the [[Football Association of Wales]] confronted FIFA about the confiscation of the bucket hats, and FIFA entered talks with the Qatari Supreme Committee to discuss Qatar's commitment to make all fans welcome at the World Cup, also citing an incident of an American fan with a rainbow flag being harassed.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-22 |title=Fifa and Qatar in urgent talks after Wales rainbow hats confiscated |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/22/fifa-qatar-talks-wales-rainbow-hats-confiscated-world-cup |access-date=2022-11-22 |website=The Guardian }}</ref>

===Wales vs Iran===
[[File:Iran v Wales in the 2022 FIFA World Cup Match 17 - 11.jpg | thumb|During the match between Wales and Iran]]
Wales had faced Iran previously only once, a 1–0 friendly win in 1978.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wales national football team: record v Iran |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/wales/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/iran/ |website=11v11.com |access-date=6 June 2022}}</ref> The Iranian team opted to sing their national anthem at this match.

The game was driven by Iran in attack and quick counter-attack, with Wales mostly holding in defence; though Wales made attempts in attack, their midfield was described by [[BBC Sport]]'s Dafydd Pritchard as "worryingly porous". In the first half, Iran had a goal from [[Ali Gholizadeh]] disallowed by VAR for offside. Early in the second half, Iran had two attempts hit each post in quick succession.<ref name=BBCWalesIran/> In the 86th minute, Welsh goalkeeper [[Wayne Hennessey]] was originally given a yellow card for a foul he committed outside his [[penalty area]]. However, following review by VAR, this was upgraded to a red card. Iran substitute [[Rouzbeh Cheshmi]] scored the match's first goal eight minutes into stoppage time, followed by [[Ramin Rezaeian]] scoring three minutes later to give Iran a first-ever win against a European team at the FIFA World Cup.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.co.uk/football/story/_/id/37634267/2022-world-cup-stats-fifa-qatar-eliminated-iran-beat-wales-enner-valencia-record|title=2022 World Cup stats: Iran get first win over European side, hosts Qatar eliminated|date=26 November 2022|website=ESPN.com}}</ref> Cheshmi's goal was the latest-minute match-winning goal scored in any World Cup game (excluding extra time) since the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] in [[England]], when exact goal times were first made available.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/Wales-vs-Iran/462978 |last=Wright |first=Nick |title=World Cup 2022 – Wales 0–2 Iran: Late goals condemn Rob Page's side to defeat after Wayne Hennessey sent off |publisher=skysports.co |date=25 November 2022 |access-date=25 November 2022}}</ref> Officially, nine minutes of stoppage time were added; with further delays in the added time, over twelve minutes were actually played.<ref name=BBCWalesIran>{{Cite news |title=Iran loss leaves Wales in danger of World Cup exit |work=BBC Sport |access-date=25 November 2022 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63603418}}</ref>

===Wales vs England===
The teams had met 103 times, most recently in a friendly game in 2020 won 3–0 by England. This was their second meeting in a major tournament, the first being the group stage of [[UEFA Euro 2016]], which ended in a [[UEFA Euro 2016 Group B#England vs Wales|2–1]] win for England. The teams had met in multiple [[FIFA World Cup qualification|FIFA World Cup qualifiers]], including two [[British Home Championship]] matches that served as World Cup qualifiers (in [[1949–50 British Home Championship|1949–50]] and [[1953–54 British Home Championship|1953–54]]), as well as in the [[1974 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 5|1974]] and [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 6|2006]] qualification campaigns.<ref>{{cite web |title=England national football team: record v Wales |url=https://www.11v11.com/teams/england/tab/opposingTeams/opposition/Wales/ |access-date=5 June 2022 |website=11v11.com}}</ref>

[[Marcus Rashford]] had the best chance of the opening period, but his chipped shot was saved by Wales goalkeeper [[Danny Ward (Welsh footballer)|Danny Ward]]. Following a goalless first half, Rashford scored a direct free kick in the 51st minute to give England the lead. Shortly after the restart, England would double the lead after Rashford won the ball in the Welsh defence and passed to [[Harry Kane]], whose crossed ball low from the right was converted at the back post by [[Phil Foden]]. Rashford got his second of the game in the 68th minute, with a shot from deep inside the Welsh penalty area that went through the goalkeeper's legs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63603442 |title=Wales 0 England 3 |date=29 November 2022 |work=BBC Sport |access-date=30 November 2022}}</ref> The victory was enough for England to finish at the top of the group, whilst Wales finished at the bottom with just one point.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/29/wales-england-world-cup-group-b-match-report |title=Marcus Rashford double puts England top of group and sends Wales home |date=29 November 2022 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=30 November 2022}}</ref>

==Discipline==
Fair play points would have been used as tiebreakers if the overall and head-to-head records of teams were tied. These were calculated based on yellow and red cards received in all group matches as follows:<ref name="regulations"/>
*first yellow card: −1 point;
*indirect red card (second yellow card): −3 points;
*direct red card: −4 points;
*yellow card and direct red card: −5 points;

Only one of the above deductions was applied to a player in a single match.
